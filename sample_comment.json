I take some solace though in knowing that Blogger's own announcement blog will be affected too, though since Google seems to be moving their own communication to the platforms created by others (as witnessed by the +Google account suggesting people to follow them on Twitter and Medium instead), I wouldn't be surprised if Google ends up moving their own blogs to something like Medium, as several of Google's developer advocates / Googlers are already posting there."

Seriously, your previous post on this blog is from May 2018\ud83e\udd14 you're not setting the best example of remaining active on your own blog. It should've been known already from August that Google+ Comments on Blogger would be affected as well, and yet you still decided to not even tell the Blogger users that their platform would be affected too. Instead, you silently ignored many requests for clarification from our users, and left broken links to Google+ related help documents in the Blogger settings interface, even though they were reported several times through various channels by me and other users."
