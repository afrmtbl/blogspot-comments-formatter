	<b>Lack of Migration Path</b><br>I'm disappointed that <a href="https://plus.google.com/116899029375914044550">+Google</a> / <a href="https://plus.google.com/110587955497525318489">+Blogger</a>  are not offering a migration path from Google+ Comments on Blogger back to the native Blogger Comments, especially after you encouraged blogs to start using the G+ integration too. I take some solace though in knowing that Blogger's own announcement blog will be affected too, though since Google seems to be moving their own communication to the platforms created by others (as witnessed by the +Google account suggesting people to follow them on Twitter and Medium instead), I wouldn't be surprised if Google ends up moving their own blogs to something like Medium, as several of Google's developer advocates / Googlers are already posting there.<br><br><b>Took you long enough...</b><br>What further disappoints me, is how you, Google/Blogger, have taken this long to actually inform the Blogger users of this. Seriously, your previous post on this blog is from May 2018ðŸ¤” you're not setting the best example of remaining active on your own blog. It should've been known already from August that Google+ Comments on Blogger would be affected as well, and yet you still decided to not even tell the Blogger users that their platform would be affected too. Instead, you silently ignored many requests for clarification from our users, and left broken links to Google+ related help documents in the Blogger settings interface, even though they were reported several times through various channels by me and other users.<br><br><b>Broken support links</b><br>Actually, those broken links are still there, for instance the Learn More link for Google+ Comments in the Blogger settings for Posts and Comments interface is still pointing to the broken link <a href="https://www.blogger.com/go/gpluscommentshelp">https://www.blogger.com/go/gpluscommentshelp</a>
What's worse perhaps is that you haven't even bothered yet to include a notice linking to this blog page, at the top of every setting page. The GDPR / cookies notice is still there, so why not add one about this too?<br>No, instead the interface even encourages blog owners to switch to Google+ Comments.<br><br><b>Missed opportunity</b><br>It's a shame Google didn't take this opportunity to offer Google+ users to directly import their Collections into Blogger. Such a missed opportunity that one has to wonder if Blogger perhaps is next on the cutting board... Or, perhaps every team within Google loathes being forced to integrate with Google+ in the past, and now resents them for it, and take it out on the loyal users?<br><br><a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23GooglePlusShutdown/posts">#GooglePlusShutdown</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23GPlus/posts">#GPlus</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Plexodus/posts">#Plexodus</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Blogger/posts">#Blogger</a><br><br>(Edited to add formatting.)<br><br><b>Relevant links:</b><br>â€¢ Blogger's announcement: <a href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2019/01/an-update-on-google-and-blogger.html">https://blogger.googleblog.com/2019/01/an-update-on-google-and-blogger.html</a><br>â€¢ Google's announcement: <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9195133">https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9195133</a><br>â€¢ Google's F.A.Q.: <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723">https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723</a><br>â€¢ Google's F.A.Q. answer regarding Google+ Comments for Blogger: <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723#blogger">https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723#blogger</a><br><br>(Edited again to add the above footer with relevant links, for reshares on <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23GooglePlus/posts">#GooglePlus</a>.)
